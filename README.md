### Important (User) Instructions 


Dear user, 

Welcome to our Word Association Game. Our program will store your word associations and allow you to keep track of however many records you decide to create. The number of entries you will be asked to complete will depend on you so, go crazy! You will be asked to enter a word and another word you associate with it for each entry. Please refrain from choosing the same word twice. You can give each association any score you feel fit. Your input will be saved in a database, and in the end, the contents of the entire database and a summary of your input will appear on your screen. This means you will also see the average of all your scores! We hope you can have fun with this game and make new discoveries. Thank you again for choosing our program!

Sincerely,


Three students from a computer science class
